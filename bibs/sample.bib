	abstract = {Topological mechanical metamaterials are a type of structure, which can be used to design and control softness. They have been proposed as components for many applications, including for cushioning mechanical shocks and isolation of mechanical deformations as well as controlling actuation and failure. We provide a realization of a specific type of topological structure{\textemdash}a gapped topological lattice in three dimensions. We then use this structure to localize soft deformations either on the surface of the material or in the bulk along line defects called dislocations.Topological states can be used to control the mechanical properties of a material along an edge or around a localized defect. The rigidity of elastic networks is characterized by a topological invariant called the polarization; materials with a well-defined uniform polarization display a dramatic range of edge softness depending on the orientation of the polarization relative to the terminating surface. However, in all 3D mechanical metamaterials proposed to date, the topological modes are mixed with bulk soft modes, which organize themselves in Weyl loops. Here, we report the design of a 3D topological metamaterial without Weyl lines and with a uniform polarization that leads to an asymmetry between the number of soft modes on opposing surfaces. We then use this construction to localize topological soft modes in interior regions of the material by including defect lines{\textemdash}dislocation loops{\textemdash}that are unique to three dimensions. We derive a general formula that relates the difference in the number of soft modes and states of self-stress localized along the dislocation loop to the handedness of the vector triad formed by the lattice polarization, Burgers vector, and dislocation-line direction. Our findings suggest a strategy for preprogramming failure and softness localized along lines in 3D, while avoiding extended soft Weyl modes.},

	abstract = {Origami, the ancient art of folding paper, has recently emerged as a method for creating deployable and reconfigurable engineering systems. These systems tend to be flexible because the thin sheets bend and twist easily. We introduce a new method of assembling origami into coupled tubes that can increase the origami stiffness by two orders of magnitude. The new assemblages can deploy through a single flexible motion, but they are substantially stiffer for any other type of bending or twisting movement. This versatility can be used for deployable structures in robotics, aerospace, and architecture. On a smaller scale, assembling thin sheets into these tubular assemblages can create metamaterials that can be deployed, stiffened, and tuned.Thin sheets have long been known to experience an increase in stiffness when they are bent, buckled, or assembled into smaller interlocking structures. We introduce a unique orientation for coupling rigidly foldable origami tubes in a {\textquotedblleft}zipper{\textquotedblright} fashion that substantially increases the system stiffness and permits only one flexible deformation mode through which the structure can deploy. The flexible deployment of the tubular structures is permitted by localized bending of the origami along prescribed fold lines. All other deformation modes, such as global bending and twisting of the structural system, are substantially stiffer because the tubular assemblages are overconstrained and the thin sheets become engaged in tension and compression. The zipper-coupled tubes yield an unusually large eigenvalue bandgap that represents the unique difference in stiffness between deformation modes. Furthermore, we couple compatible origami tubes into a variety of cellular assemblages that can enhance mechanical characteristics and geometric versatility, leading to a potential design paradigm for structures and metamaterials that can be deployed, stiffened, and tuned. The enhanced mechanical properties, versatility, and adaptivity of these thin sheet systems can provide practical solutions of varying geometric scales in science and engineering.},

	abstract = {Many biological forms, such as leaves, flowers, and faces, are shaped by complex growth patterns. How can we prescribe the rules of growth on a simple surface so that it will morph into a flower or a face? Here, we solve this inverse problem of designing the growth patterns for an anisotropically growing elastic bilayer structure and prove that it can be used to achieve any target surface shape from any reference shape. We demonstrate the applicability of this result via the computational design of growth patterns for animal, vegetable, and mineral surfaces{\textemdash}a face, a flower, and a canyon. Our solution provides algorithms for engineering complex functional shapes in tissues, and actuation systems in soft robotics, and elsewhere.Inspired by the differential-growth-driven morphogenesis of leaves, flowers, and other tissues, there is increasing interest in artificial analogs of these shape-shifting thin sheets made of active materials that respond to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, and humidity. But how can we determine the growth patterns to achieve a given shape from another shape? We solve this geometric inverse problem of determining the growth factors and directions (the metric tensors) for a given isotropic elastic bilayer to grow into a target shape by posing and solving an elastic energy minimization problem. A mathematical equivalence between bilayers and curved monolayers simplifies the inverse problem considerably by providing algebraic expressions for the growth metric tensors in terms of those of the final shape. This approach also allows us to prove that we can grow any target surface from any reference surface using orthotropically growing bilayers. We demonstrate this by numerically simulating the growth of a flat sheet into a face, a cylindrical sheet into a flower, and a flat sheet into a complex canyon-like structure.},

	abstract = {Elastic gridshells arise from the buckling of an initially planar grid of rods. The interaction of elasticity and geometric constraints makes their actuated shapes difficult to predict using classical methods. However, recent progress in extreme mechanics reveals the benefits of structures that buckle by design, when exploiting underlying geometry. Here, we demonstrate the geometry-driven nature of elastic gridshells. We use a geometric model, originally for woven fabric, to rationalize their actuated shapes and describe their nonlocal response to loading. Validation is provided with precision experiments and rod-based simulations. The prominence of geometry in elastic gridshells that we identify should allow for our results to transfer across length scales from architectural structures to micro/nano{\textendash}1-df mechanical actuators and self-assembly systems.Elastic gridshells comprise an initially planar network of elastic rods that are actuated into a shell-like structure by loading their extremities. The resulting actuated form derives from the elastic buckling of the rods subjected to inextensibility. We study elastic gridshells with a focus on the rational design of the final shapes. Our precision desktop experiments exhibit complex geometries, even from seemingly simple initial configurations and actuation processes. The numerical simulations capture this nonintuitive behavior with excellent quantitative agreement, allowing for an exploration of parameter space that reveals multistable states. We then turn to the theory of smooth Chebyshev nets to address the inverse design of hemispherical elastic gridshells. The results suggest that rod inextensibility, not elastic response, dictates the zeroth-order shape of an actuated elastic gridshell. As it turns out, this is the shape of a common household strainer. Therefore, the geometry of Chebyshev nets can be further used to understand elastic gridshells. In particular, we introduce a way to quantify the intrinsic shape of the empty, but enclosed regions, which we then use to rationalize the nonlocal deformation of elastic gridshells to point loading. This justifies the observed difficulty in form finding. Nevertheless, we close with an exploration of concatenating multiple elastic gridshell building blocks.},

abstract = {In the past decade, mechanical metamaterials have garnered increasing attention owing to its novel design principles which combine the concept of hierarchical architecture with material size effects at micro/nanoscale. This strategy is demonstrated to exhibit superior mechanical performance that allows us to colonize unexplored regions in the material property space, including ultrahigh strength-to-density ratios, extraordinary resilience, and energy absorption capabilities with brittle constituents. In the recent years, metamaterials with unprecedented mechanical behaviors such as negative Poisson's ratio, twisting under uniaxial forces, and negative thermal expansion are also realized. This paves a new pathway for a wide variety of multifunctional applications, for example, in energy storage, biomedical, acoustics, photonics, and thermal management. Herein, the fundamental scientific theories behind this class of novel metamaterials, along with their fabrication techniques and potential engineering applications beyond mechanics are reviewed. Explored examples include the recent progresses for both mechanical and functional applications. Finally, the current challenges and future developments in this emerging field is discussed as well.},

	abstract = {A flat plate will bend into a curved shell if it experiences an inhomogeneous growth field or if constrained appropriately at a boundary. While the forward problem associated with this process is well studied, the inverse problem of designing the boundary conditions or growth fields to achieve a particular shape is much less understood. We use ideas from variational optimization theory to formulate a well posed version of this inverse problem to determine the optimal growth field or boundary condition that will give rise to an arbitrary target shape, optimizing for both closeness to the target shape and for smoothness of the growth field. We solve the resulting system of PDE numerically using finite element methods with examples for both the fully non-symmetric case as well as for simplified one-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. We also show that the system can also be solved semi-analytically by positing an ansatz for the deformation and growth fields in a circular disk with given thickness profile, leading to paraboloidal, cylindrical and saddle-shaped target shapes, and show how a soft mode can arise from a non-axisymmetric deformation of a structure with axisymmetric material properties.}

First, under the assumption of plane strain, we formulate the 3D governing system for a multi-layered hyperelastic (neo-Hookean) plate, which incorporates the growth parameters in the different layers. Based on the governing system and by adopting a series expansion–truncation approach, we derive a plate equation system. In the case of traction-free boundary conditions, we solve the plate equation system explicitly and obtain some simple analytical results, which can be used to describe the deformations of the multi-layered plates induced by growth. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical results through comparisons with some numerical and experimental results. We also provide a comparison between the analytical results obtained for single- and multi-layered hyperelastic plates. Furthermore, we analyze the properties of residual stresses in the multi-layered plates. The plate equation system and the analytical results obtained here have wide potential applications in the design of intelligent soft devices."
