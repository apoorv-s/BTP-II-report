\chapter{Future Work}


While the current work is focused toward developing a program which can simulate a lattice, it will be used for studying following behavior of the lattices.

\section{Form Finding}
This will involve studying the shapes that lattice takes under different stimulus such tweaking the spring lengths, varying stiffness of the springs, providing pre-tensions in the spring and so on. This will be used to induce curvature, morphing into different shapes and so on.

\section{Vibration Modes \& Wave Propagation}
Using the concepts of reciprocal lattice in addition to the program, the phonon modes of the structure and other relevant lattice characteristics can be determined which will provide insights into the vibrational modes of lattice and wave propagation characteristic of the lattice.
